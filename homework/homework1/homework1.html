            <ol>The Secret Recipe 
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>Grease & line your baking tin with baking paper then preheat your oven to 180°C/Fan 170°C.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Add the butter into a large bowl and break in the chocolate. <br>Melt in the microwave in 20 second intervals, stirring well between each time. Try not to overheat. <br> Leave to one side for a few minutes to cool to room temperature.</li>
                <br>

                <li>One at a time, beat in the eggs. Mix very well.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Add in the sugar and give it a really good beating with a spatula or whisk. It should stop being really grainy and become quite smooth.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Stir through the vanilla & salt then sift in the flour & cocoa powder. <br>Fold it all together with a spatula but don’t overdo it. Fold just until you can’t see anymore flour left in the batter.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Pour the lot into your prepared tin and smooth out evenly. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes. <br>It will likely be a little crispy on top but fear not, there is lots of gorgeous chocolatey goo underneath!</li>
                <br>

                <li>The pegs? Yes, that’s what happens when you’re lazy and only line the base & 2 sides of your tin. The paper falls onto the brownie & creates unsightly lines on the top until you notice and peg it back up. Oops. <br><br>Anyway! Allow to cool completely before removing from the tin and slicing into 9 or 16 bars.</li>


            </ol>
